# Titanic dataset 
### About
Given a raw dataset of the passengers on the titanic ship to build a model that predicts the passengers that survived the wreck depending on the features provided ie Sex, Passenger_class, and age among other factors. But before building the model, i needed to clean up the data and get rid of the unwanted columns, manage any errors and add any columns I would need.
## What I changed in the dataset
- Removed the unwanted columns of zeros
- Added the column for names of the passengers
- Renamed the survived column as it was mispelled.
- Coverted the sex column to a string rather that an integer
  
The end output is a clean dataset I think that can be used to build the model
